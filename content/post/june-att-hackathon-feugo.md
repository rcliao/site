## What did you do in Hackathon?

In this hackathon, we build a project called **Feugo ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥**.

Originally, this project was named as "ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥"; but because of someone *ahem*, we have to rename it to Feugo!

## So what is Feugo?

Feugo is a social voting for dance off competition.

## How did you use to build Feugo?

It was built with three parts -- **mobile app**, **AT&T flow designer server** and **Raspberry Pi (the battle station)**.

I was responsible for the mobile app portion.

Since it's being a long time before last hackathon, I want to start with something I am more or less familiar with but also want to try out a bleeding toy.

Therefore, I decide to start the project with *Ionic2*.

At the first day (Friday after working 8 hours), I had some struggle getting Ionic2 to work the way I want. Specifically on the syntax changes and its build system.

However, it's quite interesting to see the big syntax difference between Ionic2 and Ionic.

Ionic2 starter kit starts with ES6 syntax which is not too new for me. Although my preference on the language is toward type script, I think it makes sense for Ionic2 to start with ES6 because most front end developers are more willing to adapt ES6 than TypeScript.

I'd still hope Ionic2 gave me option to code in TypeScript though.

Another big change from Ionic to Ionic2 is its navigation changes. In Ionic2, we have a new service called NavController that uses stack implementation to do navigation.

I **love** this change because it reduces a lot of complexity on the navigation in Ionic. For me, as software developer, stack is quite easy to understand and use.

In addition to the easy to understand, I also love the fact about this stack implementation provides the back button out of box on each navigation. Usually this back button is pain in the butt to implement ...

Overall, I had great time using Ionic2 and I think I'll continue using it for future hackathon!
